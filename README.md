This means that the Lindbergh Blue series can be considered End of Life.

Enough StarHorse2 parts have been sold on Yahoo Auctions Japan, that it is a fair time to help folks attempting to restore these wonderful machines.

It is also clear that there are several closet Derby Oweners Club installations that require restoration work so people can still "Feel The Rush"!

Lucky for you, after nearly 7 years of sales, the WalsDawg Lindbergh Multi is no longer a viable cash cow, so we are comfortable sharing more info on the system.

Back in the early days we were one of few non hacked up multi's for Lindy! We also sold single games for archival purposes. 
"We sell a different version that does not have so many hacks and that stays more true to the original.'
"We can sell you a kit with just VF5 Final Showdown for $145."

About a week after we Formally introducing: DarkDawg Collaborations, we started selling the Lindy multi kit.

# Stage Two:
Over time the scene evolved and tools were shared. Discussions were often censored, and the tools always disappeared for some reason. 
"some of you might know crediar, he does alot in the console scene and now released some cool tools for Lindbergh"

An emulator even made a brief appearance that came and went quickly.

There was quite a bit of contention over who's multi was *first*, and most importantly who's was *best*.

"Long story short : 2 multis, one by Android ("authorization" sold to Darksoft & Mitsu who still sell kits here) and one by Jackalus (sold by mar.veto). Android claims Jackalus has hacked his hack to make his multi (multi is just a hack)."

Former f-secure Jr Malware Analyst Nico Giansanti eventually turned his Lindbergh work into a pay for play component of his Teknoparrot project.

Giansanti's Lindbergh work was done under the monikers Jackalus, Reaver, among others such a Junnumane, and Teknoparrot.

"Until fall 2017, to own a multi you had to make a choice ... and go to the cashier! 
Darksoft version with its original versions but its keyboard selection and the Jackalus version without keyboard but deemed less stable. 

And then Crediar posted download links for a new version. A post appeared on Arcade Project but quickly deleted by the administrators. 
Official reason: system still in operation 
Unofficial reason: the multi still bring a lot of money to the two dealers holding the precious secret."

We were able to protect our Kit very well and maximize profits, both via censorship, and amazing technical means. They were beautiful

"So the multikits have a specific CF card and PIC. The CF card is locked so it can't be read and duplicated. Same with the PIC. The multikits were designed to be sold so the PIC is not interchangeable."
